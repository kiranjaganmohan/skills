## Available Skills

### AEM Edge Delivery Services

This package provides three capability areas:
- Core development workflow skills
- Discovery and documentation lookup skills
- Migration and import workflow skills

See `skills/aem/edge-delivery-services/skills/` for the current concrete skill set.

### AEM as a Cloud Service — Create Component

The `create-component` skill creates complete AEM components following Adobe best practices for AEM Cloud Service and AEM 6.5. It covers:

- Component definition, dialog XML, and HTL template
- Sling Model and optional child item model (multifield)
- Unit tests for models and servlets
- Clientlibs (component and dialog)
- Optional Sling Servlet for dynamic content

See `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/create-component/` for the skill and its reference files.

### AEM as a Cloud Service — Ensure AGENTS.md (bootstrap)

The `ensure-agents-md` skill is a **bootstrap skill** that runs first, before any other work. When a
customer opens their AEM Cloud Service project and asks the agent anything, this skill checks whether
`AGENTS.md` exists at the repo root. If missing, it:

- Reads root `pom.xml` to resolve the project name and discover actual modules
- Detects add-ons (CIF, Forms, SPA type, precompiled scripts)
- Generates a tailored `AGENTS.md` with only the modules that exist, correct frontend variant, conditional
  Dispatcher MCP section, and the right resource links
- Creates `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`) so Claude-based tools also discover the guidance

If `AGENTS.md` already exists it is never overwritten.

See `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/ensure-agents-md/` for the skill, template, and module catalog.

### AEM Workflow

Workflow skills cover the full AEM Granite Workflow Engine lifecycle — from designing and implementing workflows to production debugging and incident triaging. Like Dispatcher, they are split by runtime flavor:

- `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/aem-workflow` — Cloud Service variant (no JMX, Cloud Manager logs, pipeline deploy)
- `skills/aem/6.5-lts/skills/aem-workflow` — 6.5 LTS / AMS variant (JMX, Felix Console, direct log access)

Each flavor contains the same specialist sub-skills:

| Sub-Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `workflow-model-design` | Design workflow models, step types, OR/AND splits, variables |
| `workflow-development` | Implement WorkflowProcess steps, ParticipantStepChooser, OSGi services |
| `workflow-triggering` | Start workflows from UI, code, HTTP API, or Manage Publication |
| `workflow-launchers` | Configure automatic workflow launchers on JCR events |
| `workflow-debugging` | Debug stuck, failed, or stale workflows in production |
| `workflow-triaging` | Classify incidents, determine log patterns, Splunk queries |
| `workflow-orchestrator` | Full lifecycle orchestration across all sub-skills |

### AEM Dispatcher

Dispatcher skills are split by runtime flavor to avoid mode auto-detection and keep installation explicit.
Install only one dispatcher flavor in a workspace (`cloud-service` or `6.5-lts`).

Current dispatcher flavors:
- `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/dispatcher`
- `skills/aem/6.5-lts/skills/dispatcher`

Each flavor contains parallel capability groups (workflow orchestration, config authoring, technical advisory, incident response, performance tuning, and security hardening).
Shared advisory logic is centralized under each flavor's `dispatcher/shared/references/` to reduce duplication and drift.

### AEM Replication

Replication skills for AEM 6.5 LTS cover the full content distribution lifecycle from agent configuration to troubleshooting.

**Location:** `skills/aem/6.5-lts/skills/aem-replication`

The aem-replication skill contains four specialist sub-skills:

| Sub-Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `configure-replication-agent` | Configure replication agents for publishing, dispatcher flush, and reverse replication |
| `replicate-content` | Activate and deactivate content using UI, workflows, and package manager |
| `replication-api` | Use the Replication API programmatically in custom code with complete Java examples |
| `troubleshoot-replication` | Diagnose and fix blocked queues, connectivity failures, and distribution problems |

**Key features:**
- All skills based on official AEM 6.5 LTS documentation
- Complete coverage of public Replication API (Replicator, ReplicationOptions, AgentManager, ReplicationQueue, etc.)
- 49 Java code examples for OSGi services, servlets, and workflow steps
- 12+ troubleshooting scenarios with step-by-step resolution
- 3,575 lines of comprehensive documentation

### AEM as a Cloud Service — Best Practices & Migration

Under `skills/aem/cloud-service/skills/`, **`best-practices/`** is the **general-purpose** Cloud Service skill: pattern modules, Java baseline references (SCR→OSGi DS, resolver/logging, and related refs), and day-to-day Cloud Service alignment. Use it **without** loading **migration** for greenfield or maintainability work. **`migration/`** (BPA/CAM orchestration) is **scoped to legacy AEM → AEM as a Cloud Service** (not Edge Delivery or 6.5 LTS); it **delegates** concrete refactors to **`best-practices`** (`references/`). **Installing the AEM as a Cloud Service plugin** (`aem-cloud-service`, or the `skills/aem/cloud-service` path with `npx skills` / `gh upskill`) **includes both**; the agent should load the appropriate `SKILL.md` for the task. Use **`gh upskill` / `npx skills` with `--skill`** when you need a specific bundled skill (see **Installation** above).

**Key features:**
- **Best practices:** one skill for patterns, SCR→OSGi DS, and resolver/logging — applicable to Cloud Service projects generally, not only migration
- **Migration:** orchestration-only; pattern and transformation content lives in **`best-practices`**
